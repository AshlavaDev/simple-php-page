# Simple PHP Web Page(s)

## Ashley Morgan

### Description

This is just a small project to help me grasp PHP as I learn it for web development. This readme will also help to remind me (Ashley) of how this file operates, as a PHP index file will work differently to an HTML one despite the contents mostly being the same. So this project folder will not be run through VS Code like most of my simple projects, but rather copy and pasted to the XAMPP folder to run through an Apache server on the local host.
